Tool for visualizing algorithms

Currently tool only supports pahtfinding algorithms,
which you can run and visualize by selecting a start and end point on the grid.

You can customise the grid by either drawing obstacles on it manually,
or generating a maze automatically.

Current supported algorithms:
- Dijkstra
- A* Search
- Randomized prim's algorithm for generating a maze

The nodes that algorithm visits are colored depending on the weight value they're generated by the algorithm.
The shortest path that's found between the start and goal node is displayed in orange color.
